## Operational Efficiency Roadmap (2026-03-20)

> Stack-ranked by ROI. Derived from analysis of all project conversation history.
> Goal: reduce friction, accelerate development velocity, improve code quality.

| Rank | ID | Item | Effort | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | OE-01 | **Adopt Claude Code for dev sessions** — eliminate cd/chmod/paste friction, auto-iterate on errors, full repo context without handover reads | 2hr setup | ⬜ |
| 2 | OE-02 | **Shell aliases + project Makefile** — `lp` alias, `lpd`, `lpc` shortcuts, `make deploy-mcp`, `make test`, `make commit` | 15min | ⬜ |
| 3 | OE-03 | **Tool surface management** — create build-mode (LP+FS+AWS only) vs planning-mode tool configs. Disconnect unused MCP tools per session type. | 10min/session | ⬜ |
| 4 | OE-04 | **Pin stable docs as Project Knowledge** — ARCHITECTURE.md, SCHEMA.md, DECISIONS.md as auto-loaded project context. Reserve handovers for session state only. | 15min | ⬜ |
| 5 | OE-05 | **Terminal anti-pattern fixes** — disable AWS CLI pager (`aws configure set cli_pager ""`), always use `bash script.sh` not `./script.sh`, never paste multi-line with `#` comments | 5min | ⬜ |
| 6 | OE-06 | **Local test-before-deploy discipline** — `make test` before every `make deploy`. Catch missing modules, bad imports, broken signatures pre-production. | Ongoing | ⬜ |
| 7 | OE-07 | **Expand operational memory** — commit anti-patterns to memory proactively on first encounter (not after 2nd/3rd). Focus on "things that break every few weeks." | Ongoing | ⬜ |
| 8 | OE-08 | **Use Deep Research for technical decisions** — complement Board of Directors (qualitative judgment) with Deep Research (quantitative data, benchmarks, current best practices) | Per-decision | ⬜ |
| 9 | OE-09 | **Consolidate session-end documentation** — audit FEATURES.md, USER_GUIDE.md, MCP_TOOL_CATALOG.md for overlap. Reduce 8+ doc updates to essential 3-4. | 1hr | ⬜ |
| 10 | OE-10 | **Local dev environment standardization** — pinned Python venv with `requirements-dev.txt`, consistent `pip install` without `--break-system-packages`. Consider Docker dev container. | 1hr | ⬜ |

### Design Language (Ava Moreau)
- Background: `#0D1117` · Text: `#E6EDF3` · Accent: `#F0B429`
- Data positive: `#2EA98F` · Data negative: `#E85D5D` · Secondary: `#8B949E`
- Typography: Inter (headlines) · JetBrains Mono (data/code)

### Commercialization
- Wedge: AI Health Coaching Email ($19-49/month). Infrastructure built. Needs audience first.
- Path 3 (Content/Media) elevated — fastest to first dollar, no extra engineering.
- Per-user Opus cost ~$1.80/month — model routing essential before multi-user.

### Next Summit Trigger
Board Summit #3: 500 subscribers OR 90-day journey milestone (2026-05-22), whichever comes first.
