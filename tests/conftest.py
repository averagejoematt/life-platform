tests/conftest.py — global pytest path setup.

Added 2026-05-25 (P3.1): when lambdas/ was reorganized into subpackages
(ingestion/, compute/, coach/, email/, web/, operational/, intelligence/),
existing tests that did `import whoop_lambda` directly broke. This conftest
adds each subpackage to sys.path so flat-name imports continue to work.

Tests that use the standard `sys.path.insert(0, "../lambdas")` pattern
get both the lambdas/ root (for shared-layer modules) AND each subpackage
visible. New tests can prefer `from ingestion.whoop_lambda import ...` but
legacy `import whoop_lambda` still resolves.

# offline/shaped-empty path — that's exactly what happens in CI, whose "Unit
# Tests" job never configures AWS credentials at all, so boto3 raises
# NoCredentialsError before any network call. On a developer machine with a
# real ~/.aws/credentials file, those same calls silently succeed against
# live AWS instead, producing real data and failing the offline assumption
# (four tests in test_coaches_api.py, 2026-07-03).

# Tests that intentionally exercise live AWS are marked `@pytest.mark.integration`

# Force the fakes on at *import* time (i.e. collection), not just per-test setup.
# Several production modules build a boto3 client at their own module level
# (e.g. lambdas/web/site_api_coach.py: `_S3 = boto3.client("s3", ...)`), and those
# modules get imported the moment a test file does `from web import site_api_coach`
# during collection — before any per-test fixture has run. boto3 resolves and
# caches credentials on its shared default Session the first time any client is
# built, and that cache is NOT re-read from the environment afterward — so a
# per-test-only override would arrive too late for any module-level client that
# collection already constructed with real creds. Setting the fakes here, before
# pytest imports any test (or the production code it pulls in), keeps every
# module-level client hermetic too.

    Fake credentials are already active process-wide (see module-level override
    above), which is correct for the overwhelming majority of tests: any boto3
    call must fail with a ClientError/NoCredentials-style exception exactly as it
    does in CI, so code under test exercises the same offline fallback path
    regardless of the developer's local ~/.aws profile.

    Tests marked `@pytest.mark.integration` are the deliberate exception — they
    exist specifically to call live AWS. For those, restore the developer's real
    ambient credentials (if any) for the duration of the test. Restoring the env
    vars alone isn't enough: boto3 caches resolved credentials on its shared
    default Session the first time a client is built (which may have already
    happened with the fakes above, earlier in this same run), so also drop that
    cached session for the test to force a fresh credential resolution — and
    again on the way out, so the fakes are what the *next* (non-integration)
    test's first client build sees.
